# Mahjong API

This is a repository for a Mahjong score tracker. The goal is to have the following features:

- Score your Mahjong hand according to several scoring systems, including Hong-Kong Old Scoring or Chinese International Scoring
- Track the score throughout a game by submitting hands
- Access this through the front-end web app, synced between players here

## How to run locally

First, initialise the venv with

```bash
make venv
```

then run the local instance via

```bash
make start
```

that runs the API on default port 8000.
